			<h2>History</h2><br>
			<p>Taclobo High School used to be located in the vicinity of West Elementary School, along Cervantes Street in Dumaguete. It occupied only a very limited area consisting of less than fifteen classrooms, in which building used were ones of the West City Elementary School buildings. It was built there since the Barangay Hall is located just in its vicinity. By the year 2007, the City Government of Dumaguete appropriated funds and settled a new site for the school. Taclobo High School is now situated at West Taclobo, in the boundary of Barangay Batinguel and Taclobo, going inside Pal Subdivision, specifically, 9°18′49″N 123°17′18″ECoordinates: 9°18′49″N 123°17′18″E. The school currently has 21 classrooms and 1 building that serves as the Principal's office. Six of these rooms come from the donation of the Filipino-Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Super Lee, Inc. Currently there are two more rooms being built to completion.</p>
			<p>Taclobo High school started operation in June 1999 by virtue of Republic act no. 7803 dated September 01, 1994. During its first year of operation only first year was opened and classes were held at the Mini- Theater of West City Elementary School. Two sections of 50 students each were handed by the three teachers. In June 2000, the second year level was opened. With the increase in enrollment the additional classes were held at the second floor of the Department of the Interior and Local Government or DILG which is now Taclobo Barangay Hall and at Dumaguete City High school.</p>
			<p>When Taclobo High School graduated its first batch, the school had 377 students, eight teachers and one teacher Aide (Mrs. Gina Cordero). Accommodating the increasing population became a pressing problem. In 2004, the local school Board purchased lots containing an area of 8,687 square meters at a price amount of four million pesos for the Taclobo High School site. The purchased lots are situated at the boundary of Barangay Batinguel and Barangay Taclobo. Additional land was purchase to cater the growth of the High School.</p>
